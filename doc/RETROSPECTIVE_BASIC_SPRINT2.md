### What worked:
- Base game now has full functionality minus some features.
- Moving people into other roles to account for missing features.
### What didnâ€™t work:
- Lack of communication.
- Not clearly assigning issues.
### Topics that need attention:
- Figure out which final features we will implement.
- Focus on refining front end styling.
- Finalize backend testing.
- Implement all front end testing.
  -Implement additional error-handling.
### Roles:
- Backend team was basically absent this week as more focus had to be done on frontend, and would like to refocus on finalizing backend implementation and testing.
### Plan:
- More frequent meetings.
- Better communication in the group chat.
- Assign issues quickly and with purpose.
