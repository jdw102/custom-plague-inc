Here we outline three potential variations for the app-based game Plague Inc and discuss how they differ in their functionality. 

## Variation 1: Infection Mode
This is the normal plague infection mode. This mode has the user choosing a starting infection type
and a starting country location, then upgrading their virus as they infect more people by buying
perks with user owned points called DNA Points. This mode will have the region parameters be total 
population, infected population, and dead population, with the total population of each region growing with
a birth rate, and an infected and dead population affected by the parameters of the chosen virus. The user wins
by killing the entire population and loses if a vaccine is developed (i.e. the cure progress bar reaches 100%) or
every infected person dies. 

## Variation 2: Cure Mode
This is the cure mode. This mode is similar to the normal mode in that there is an infection spreading with probabilities
and infection amounts determined by parameters, but instead of purchasing perks that increase the effectiveness of the
infection you purchase perks that allow you to set up research facilities in other regions, that speed up the cure progress,
and upgrade the vaccine in ways that inhibit the growth of the infection. This means perks will actually decrease
the parameters of the virus instead and the winning condition will be that the cure reaches 100% and the losing condition is
that the virus kills the global population.

## Variation 3: So You Want to be a Billionaire?
This mode involves the user trying to sell enough of their product so that they can reach a billion dollars in revenue.
This mode is different in that the user will be accruing wealth based on the percentage of the population that buys their 
product and will buy perks for advertising their products and shipping their products to certain countries. Region factors
will actually revolve around the economic state of the country, whether it is hyper-capitalist, hyper-communist, or normal, 
and other factors to be determined.
