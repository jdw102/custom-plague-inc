#### Extension Feature(s)
The basic extensions we want to include are load and save games. This will save the state of every region,
all actor, antagonist, and world data. To load the game, we will use the saved state to generate
constructors. Our challenging extension will be the game area editor. For our first working model, this will
look like a grid that allows the user to dynamically create a map of regions with different colors. In our
final version, this can also include the user to input the values necessary to create the config files.
