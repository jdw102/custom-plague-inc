## As a project team, we promise to:
* respect each other's ideas and work
* communicate with the team regularly to keep everyone in the loop about the project
* be willing to help each other
* constantly challenge ourselves to design cleaner and better code
* proactively communicate potential issues/conflicts as well as project updates

## If someone on our team breaks one or more of these promises, the team may:
* have a team meeting and ask the person to follow this agreement
* report the issue in the Team Sprint Report
* talk to our individual TAs

## Team Procedures
* meet at least twice a week as a team (may need to be on zoom, ideally in person), pair programming 
four times a week (in person)
* our text group chat
* individual branches, merge requests that must be approved by other team members, at least 2 commits
per each coding session

### Meetings
* Each member should create a list of action items/updates and we will go through and discuss everyone's agenda
* If a team member is not able to make a team meeting in person, they should try to meet on zoom. Otherwise, they are 
expected to communicate their updates over text and the rest of the team will report our updates.
* We expect disagreements will be handled respectfully, and all major decisions to be made by majority vote. 
Priorities will depend on how pressing a feature or goal is.

### Communications
* Our decision-making policy is majority vote
* Respond to all texts within 24 hours
* We will also have a Google document with major decisions, changes, or updates

### Commitments
* Working to the "best of your ability" means working within your technical experience, pushing yourself to incorporate
better design elements, asking for help when/if necessary, going above and beyond all communications expectations, and
being engaged/excited about collaborating.
* We will set internal deadlines as a team making everyone aware of when and what is due. These will be communicated
in our group chat, as well as on the Google document.
* We can provide commitments others on the team can rely on by scheduling and attending meetings or pair programming
exercises.
* Failure to meet commitments will result in any actions from the above "If someone on our team breaks 
one or more of these promises, the team may:" section.

### Helping each other
* By meeting in person regularly and allocating time for each team member to ask questions, we will encourage asking for help!
* If a team member asks for help, others should actively attempt to help them, talk through the problem with them or suggest
resources to look into. 
* how to support the team priorities
* We can support the team priorities by communicating effectively, being engaged during team meetings, challenging
each other with design implementation, and being considerate of each other.
* When discussing specific pieces of code, we will discuss design implementation and throughout any meetings, everyone
should be willing to suggest changes and explain why.
