### What worked:
- Very basic game is functional
  - Added winning conditions & dialog
  - Regions become red as they become more infected
- Partially changing roles to account for where the team is lacking as a whole

### What didn’t work:
- Big merges → single issue merge requests
- Not frequent enough meetings

### Topics that need attention:
- Add more testing for growth and spread modeling
- Clean front end, add correct components
- Abstraction in the view package
- Animation in the view
  - Need to integrate some kind of logic for region infection
  - Animation for airplanes and boats
- View dialogs
  - Country data (infected, dead)
  - World data
- Perk Tree - pop up is implemented, need to link all of the logic to various perks
- Create the config files for other two variations
- Save & load extension
- Map builder extension

### Roles, communication, and progress discussion:
-Frontend team → prioritize testing earlier on, need more feature implantation
- Backend team → almost fully complete, must implement more in depth testing
- Parsing team → almost fully complete, possibly minor error handling stuff that will come up

### Brainstorm plan:
- Reallocate some members to other teams to focus on more pressing features
- Move parsing team focus towards extensions
- Focus on front end development and meet more frequently to discuss
