I think I got a better understanding of how flexibly APIs can be used in this discussion. We saw another team who used an API to have completely different visuals in the same section of their scene, and that made it more clear to me about how APIs are sort of a plug in point. I think we've used less of this in our game because aside from the things changed between config files, much of the core inner workings of the game is the same, so this was enlightening to see a larger API.
