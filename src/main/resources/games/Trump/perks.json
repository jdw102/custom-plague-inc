  "_comment" : "Example code for setting up perks. Type corresponds to which protagonists defined in protagonistTypes  json this is available for. Cost describes how many userpoints it costs. prereqIDs describe what previous perks need to be unlocked for this perk to be available--if this is empty, the perk is available by default. factorsModified describes any of the possible factors this perk might add and the impact (+ this amount) it will contribute. Cure complexity is not something defined in protagonist types--it is default 100 and is used as the total value that \"antagonist\" must reach, so perks that modify this will just add to this total value.",
